# Java UI Spring 2020 UW Madison

Hello and welcome! This repository contains the Java UI project I developed in the Spring of 2020 at the University of Wisconsin Madison to visualize COVID-19 cases in the United States. This project was my creative final assignment.

The year 2020 was a challenging time globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During this period, there was an immense amount of data being generated and updated daily about the number of cases, recoveries, and fatalities. It was both fascinating and crucial to be a part of the effort to interpret and represent this data in a meaningful way.
